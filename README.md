# Scheduling Algorithm Simulation Tool

 A simulation tool for scheduling and managing tasks to process. Features a random generator for the sample processes with arrival time and burst time, a single processor that handles 1 task at a time, a ready queue, and gantt chart. Uses a single-threaded ScheduledExecutorService to repeatedly run a thread a number of times per millisecond to simulate time. Has an abstract class called SchedulingAlgorithm that acts as a framework for implementing various scheduling algorithms. Plans to add more implementations for other scheduling algorithms when I feel like/when I have the time for it. This software is an assignment for college, in my CSS142 "Modeling and Simulation Theory" course.

 This software is very clunky and unoptimized. Good luck trying to use it when you have a lot of processes, especially if using SJF or SRTF since they use multiple calls of Stream.sorted() every iteration of time. I'll optimize it if I become smarter and figure out how.
